#### Written for [domased.sk](https://domased.sk/)
**Author:** Marek Paul√≠k | elvis@elvis.sk

## Description
Script for cutting out white bounding box of images in specified folder.
Few settings can be tweaked either by editing _preferences.py_ or with command line arguments.
For now (1.0.01) those are: custom bounding box and overwriting original files.

## Usage
CLI arguments overrides _preferences.py_ therefore it is recommended to use _preferences.py_ for default settings and CLI arguments for per use tweaks.  
File _preferences.py_ contains all settings, only some can be changed with CLI arguments.

### preferences.py
_extList_ contains file extensions to be processed. Currently tested only with _jpg_ and _jpeg_. Specify extensions in lowercase. Also uppercase extensions will be processed.<br>
_welcomeMsg_ turns on or off Welcome message.<br>
_overwrite_ if True, the original files will be overwritten. If False, new directory specified by _processedDir_ will be created (if it doesn't exist) and new files will be written there. Directory is created in the same direcotry as original files.<br>
_processedDir_ see _overwrite_<br>
_boundigBox_ you can set custom bounding box as list: \[left, top, right, bottom\]

### Command line arguments
**Help:** -h | Prints out help.<br>
**Welcome message:** -w | Turn on/off Welcome message.<br>
**Path to directory:** -d | If not specified with -d flag the script will prompt you. You can use both full or relative path.<br>
**Bounding Box:** -b | If only one number is supplied, all sides will be set to it. If you want each side different supply four numbers separated with comas, without spaces.

## TO DO
* progress bar
* add prefix and/or suffix to new filename
* resize longer edge of image to specified size
* resample image to specified resolution
