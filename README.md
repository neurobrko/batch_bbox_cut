#### Written for domased.sk by Marek Paul√≠k.

## Description
Script for cutting out white bounding box of images in specified folder.
Few settings can be tweaked either by editing _preferences.py_ or with command line arguments.
For now (1.0.01) those are: custom bounding box and overwriting og original files.

## Usage
CLI arguments overrides _preferences.py_ therefore it is recommended to use _preferences.py_ for default settings and CLI arguments for per use tweaks.  
File _preferences.py_ contains all settings, only some can be changed with CLI arguments.

### preferences.py
_extlist_ contains file extensions to be processed. Currently tested only with _jpg_ and _jpeg_. Specify extensions in lowercase. Also uppercase extensions will be processed.
_welcomeMsg_ turns on or off Welcome message.
_overwrite_ if True, ten original files will be overwritten. If False, new directory specified by _processedDir_ will be created (if it doesn't exist) and new files will be written there. Directory is created in the same direcotry as original files.
_processedDir_ see _overwrite_
_boundigBox_ you can set custom bounding box as list: \[left, top, right, bottom\]

### Command line arguments
**Help:** -h | Prints out help.  
**Welcome message:** -w | Turn on/off Welcome message.
