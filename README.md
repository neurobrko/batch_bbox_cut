## Description
Script for cutting out white bounding box of images in specified folder with simple progress bar indicating running of the script.
Few settings can be tweaked either by editing _preferences.py_ or with command line arguments.
## Version
1.0.12

## Usage
CLI arguments overrides _preferences.py_ therefore it is recommended to use _preferences.py_ for default settings and CLI arguments for per use tweaks.  
File _preferences.py_ contains all the settings, all of them can be changed with CLI arguments except for processed file types.

### preferences.py
***extList*** Contains file extensions to be processed. Currently tested only with _jpg_ and _jpeg_. Specify extensions in lowercase. Also uppercase extensions will be processed.<br>
***welcomeMsg*** Turns on or off Welcome message.<br>
***overwrite*** If True, the original files will be overwritten. If False, new directory specified by _processedDir_ will be created (if it doesn't exist) and new files will be written there. Directory is created in the same direcotry as original files.<br>
***processedDir*** See _overwrite_<br>
***boundingBox*** You can set custom bounding box as list: [left, top, right, bottom]<br>
***precut*** You can cut sides of image before processing. Specified as integer for percents.
***prefix*** Add prefix to new filename.<sup>_WARN_</sup><br>
***pfxSeparator*** Separator between prefix and filename. If prefix is not specified, separator is ignored.<sup>_WARN_</sup><br>
***suffix*** Add suffix to new filename.<sup>_WARN_</sup><br>
***sfxSeparator*** Separator between filename and suffix. If suffix is not specified, separator is ignored.<sup>_WARN_</sup><br>
***ppi*** Change resolution of processed image to specified value. Will not change if set to 0.<br>
***size*** Resize image with longer side to specified dimension. If custom bounding box is specified, it will be added 
after resizing, therefore its final dimensions will be as specified.<br>
***brightness*** Level of brightness enhancement to override gray background and/or shadows. Should be float over 1.0.

<sup>***WARN***</sup> _Prefix, suffix and separators are ignored if overwrite is active! Please use valid characters in filenames, there is no filename validation implemented yet!_

### Command line arguments
-h | **Help:** Prints out help.<br>
-d | **Path to directory:** If not specified with -d flag the script will prompt you. You can use both full or relative path.<br>
-b | **Bounding Box:** If only one number is supplied, all sides will be set same. If you want each side different supply four numbers separated with comas, without spaces.<br>
-c | **Precut:** You can cut sides of image before processing. Specified as integer for percents.<br>
-e | **Enhance:** Level of brightness enhancement to override gray background and/or shadows. Should be float over 1.0.<br>
-o | **Overwrite:** Overwrite original images. If both _-n_ and _-o_ are specified by accident, _-o_ is ignored.<br>
-n | **No overwrite:** Do not overwrite original images. Directory name for processed images must be supplied.<br>
-p | **Resolution:** Change resolution to specified ppi value.<br>
-s | **Resize** Resize longer side of the image to specified size. Custom bounding box is applied after resizing.<br>
-a | **Prefix:** Add prefix to filename.<sup>_WARN_</sup><br>
-A | **Prefix separator** Separator between _prefix_ and _filename_.<sup>_WARN_</sup><br>
-z | **Suffix:** Add suffix to filename.<sup>_WARN_</sup><br>
-Z | **Suffix separator** Separator between _filename_ and _prefix_.<sup>_WARN_</sup><br>
-w | **Welcome message:** Turn on/off Welcome message.<br>

<sup>***WARN***</sup> _Prefix, suffix and separators are ignored if overwrite is active! Please use valid characters in filenames, there is no filename validation implemented yet!_

## TO DO
- [ ] add option not to crop bounding box, so the script can be used for resize/change of ppi/adding prefix & suffix only (-x)
- [ ] change Resize to Side and specify as tuple of side and size. Resizing will be made according to specified side.
- [ ] add option to specify final dimensions. Cropped image will be resized to side specified and then custom 
bounding box added to specified dimensions. **PROBLEM:** Non white background
- [ ] print some useful report on exit
- [ ] add validation to resolution and resize
- [ ] add some validation to prefix, suffix and separators
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] internalization (slovak and english)
